# Business Problem:
Unplanned failure of wind turbine engines is leading to huge losses and negatively impacting electricity generation.

# Business Objective:
To analyze operational and failure log data from wind turbines to reduce unplanned downtime by 30% while maximizing power generation efficiency, and to achieve a cost saving of at least $2M per year due to the reduction of unplanned downtime, enabling data-driven decisions and supporting predictive maintenance strategies.

Note: This project was conducted as part of a data analytics internship to extract insights from historical turbine data, identify performance issues, and support proactive maintenance planning.

----------------------------

# Project Goals:
- Minimize unexpected wind turbine engine failures
- Maintain optimal power generation efficiency
- Achieve cost saving by reducing the unplanned downtime
- Enable predictive maintenance through actionable insights
- Improve overall operational reliability

----------------------------------

# Project Overview:
Wind turbines are critical components in renewable energy production. However, unplanned failures of turbine components - especially the engine, gearbox, or blades - can result in significant financial losses, operational disruptions, and decreased power generation efficiency. This project aims to conduct a comprehensive data-driven analysis of turbine failure patterns, identify key failure causes, and deliver actionable insights through dashboards and reports. The ultimate goal is to enable predictive maintenance strategies, reduce unplanned downtimes, and support data-backed decision-making for improved turbine reliability and performance.

# Project Scope:
This project involves analyzing historical wind turbine data (sensor logs, failure records, and maintenance logs) to identify the root causes of unplanned failures. The focus is on data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization of failure trends using BI tools like Power BI or Tableau. The outcome will help maintenance teams reduce downtime and make informed decisions for preventive actions.

---------------------------------

# Project Workflow:
This project follows the Data Analytics Project Management Methodology to ensure a structured, insight-driven approach to wind turbine failure analysis. I applied each stage iteratively, focusing on business relevance, data quality, and actionable insights to deliver a reliable data analytics solution that supports preventive maintenance and operational efficiency.

# Key Insights:
### Statistical Insights:
1. A large portion of wind speeds is clustered between 5 and 25 Less frequent occurrences of wind speeds above 30 (likely outliers or rare events).
2. High Variance (174.29) and Standard Deviation (13.20 m/s) shows, wind speeds are widely spread out from the mean.
3. Power generation is positively skewed and a large portion of power is clustered between 1 to  3.5 kW.
4. Mean = 3.313 kW, Mode = 1.982 kW indicating, Turbines frequently operate in low-power zones, likely due to moderate wind conditions or operational constraints.
5. The data for Nacelle_Ambient_Temp looks normally distributed but the distribution is slightly right-skewed. The temperature ranges approximately from -200°C to +300°C, though most values fall in a narrower range.
6. The Distribution of Generator bearing temperature slightly left-skewed and A large portion of the temperature clustered between 60°C to 100°C.
7. Min (9.91°C) seems too low Generator bearings should rarely operate below ambient – this could be a sensor fault or downtime reading. 


### Business Insights:
1. The most common operational wind speed ( 0-25 m/s), which might be ideal for power generation. It indicates where turbines are most effective.
2. The presence of occasional high wind speeds (30–50 m/s) could trigger emergency brakes, increasing wear and tear.
3. Wind speed should not be negative. Urgent need to review sensor calibration or data quality procedures otherwise it will cause a problem.
4. Power generation doesn’t keep pace with available wind during some periods. Investigate turbine calibration or yaw misalignment.
5. Wind Turbine not failed at Power generation of 6.96 kW, which recorded on 29th Dec 2023. So, the limit of power generation is 6.96 kW, beyond that turbine will fail.
6. There are unrealistic for nacelle temperatures, possibly sensor errors, unit mismatch, or corrupt data entries. 
7. The limit of Nacelle_Ambient_Temp of 106.16 °C, beyond that turbine will fail.
8. Wind Turbine not failed at Generator_Bearing_Temp of 98.98°C, which recorded on 16th Jun 2023. So, the limit of Generator_Bearing_Temp of 98.98°C, beyond that turbine will fail.
