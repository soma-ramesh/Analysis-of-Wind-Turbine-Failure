## Business Problem:
Unplanned failure of wind turbine engines is leading to huge losses and negatively impacting electricity generation.

## Business Objective:
To analyze operational and failure log data from wind turbines to reduce unplanned downtime by 30% while maximizing power generation efficiency, and to achieve a cost saving of at least $2M per year due to the reduction of unplanned downtime, enabling data-driven decisions and supporting predictive maintenance strategies.

Note: This project was conducted as part of a data analytics internship to extract insights from historical turbine data, identify performance issues, and support proactive maintenance planning.

----------------------------

## Project Goals:
- Minimize unexpected wind turbine engine failures
- Maintain optimal power generation efficiency
- Achieve cost saving by reducing the unplanned downtime
- Enable predictive maintenance through actionable insights
- Improve overall operational reliability

----------------------------------

## Project Overview:
Wind turbines are critical components in renewable energy production. However, unplanned failures of turbine components - especially the engine, gearbox, or blades - can result in significant financial losses, operational disruptions, and decreased power generation efficiency. This project aims to conduct a comprehensive data-driven analysis of turbine failure patterns, identify key failure causes, and deliver actionable insights through dashboards and reports. The ultimate goal is to enable predictive maintenance strategies, reduce unplanned downtimes, and support data-backed decision-making for improved turbine reliability and performance.

## Project Scope:
This project involves analyzing historical wind turbine data (sensor logs, failure records, and maintenance logs) to identify the root causes of unplanned failures. The focus is on data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization of failure trends using BI tools like Power BI or Tableau. The outcome will help maintenance teams reduce downtime and make informed decisions for preventive actions.
